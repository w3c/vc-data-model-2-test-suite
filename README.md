## Background

Provides interoperability tests for verifiable credential processors (issuers/verifiers) that support [vc-data-model-2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/).

## Install

```js
npm i
```

## Setup

You will need a [VC API compatible](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/) issuer and verifier that can handle both VCs and VPs.

The issuer endpoint will need to follow the [VC API's issuer documentation](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/#issue-credential).

A request to an issuer endpoint will look like this:

```js
{
  "credential": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2", 
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
    ],
    "id": "http://university.example/credentials/1872",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleAlumniCredential"],
    "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/565049",
    "validFrom": "2023-07-01T19:23:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
      "alumniOf": {
        "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",
        "name": "Example University"
      }
    },
  },
  "options": {}
}
```

An issuer response will look like this:

```js
{
  "verifiableCredential": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2", 
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
    ],
    "id": "http://university.example/credentials/1872",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleAlumniCredential"],
    "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/565049",
    "validFrom": "2023-07-01T19:23:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
      "alumniOf": {
        "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",
        "name": "Example University"
      }
    },
    "proof": {
      "type": "DataIntegrityProof",
      "cryptosuite": "eddsa-2022",
      "created": "2023-06-18T21:19:10Z",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "https://university.example/issuers/565049#key-1",
      "proofValue": "zQeVbY4oey...V6doDwLWx"
    }
  }
}
```

The credential verifier endpoint will also need to follow the [VC API verifier documentation](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/#verify-credential).

A request to the verifier endpoint for a credential will look like this:
```js
{
  "verifiableCredential": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2", 
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
    ],
    "id": "http://university.example/credentials/1872",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleAlumniCredential"],
    "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/565049",
    "validFrom": "2023-07-01T19:23:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
      "alumniOf": {
        "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",
        "name": "Example University"
      }
    },
    "proof": {
      "type": "DataIntegrityProof",
      "cryptosuite": "eddsa-2022",
      "created": "2023-06-18T21:19:10Z",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "https://university.example/issuers/565049#key-1",
      "proofValue": "zQeVbY4oey...V6doDwLWx"
    }
  },
  "options": {}
}

```

A response from the verifier endpoint for a credential might look like this (only HTTP response codes are checked for now):
```js
{
  "checks": ["proof"],
  "warnings": ["invalid-uri"],
  "errors": ["invalid proof"]
}
```

The presentation verifier endpoint will also need to follow the [VC API verifier documentation](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/#verify-presentation).

A request to the verifier endpoint for a presentation will look like this:
```js
{
  "verifiablePresentation": {
    "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2"],
    "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
    "holder": "did:example:holder123456789",
    "verifiableCredential": [{
      "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2", 
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
      ],
      "id": "http://university.example/credentials/1872",
      "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleAlumniCredential"],
      "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/565049",
      "validFrom": "2023-07-01T19:23:24Z",
      "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
        "alumniOf": {
          "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",
          "name": "Example University"
        }
      },
      "proof": {
        "type": "DataIntegrityProof",
        "cryptosuite": "eddsa-2022",
        "created": "2023-06-18T21:19:10Z",
        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "verificationMethod": "https://university.example/issuers/565049#key-1",
        "proofValue": "zQeVbY4oey...V6doDwLWx"
      }
    }],
    "proof": {
      "type": "DataIntegrityProof",
      "cryptosuite": "eddsa-2022",
      "challenge": "08cf4ce0-2bd0-11ee-8622-83054936f200",
      "domain": "example.com",
      "created": "2023-06-18T21:19:10Z",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "did:example:holder123456789#key-1",
      "proofValue": "zQeVbY4y...oDwLWxV6d"
    }
  },
  "options": {
    "challenge": "secret",
    "domain": "example.com"
  }
}
```

A response from the verifier endpoint for a presentation will look like this:
```js
{
  "checks": ["proof"],
  "warnings": ["invalid-uri"],
  "errors": ["invalid proof"]
}
```

Issuers and verifiers will need to not error when these contexts are used:
- [VC 2.0 Context - https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2](https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2)
- [VC Examples Context - https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2](https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2)

## Usage

```
npm test
```


## Implementation

### VC-API
To add your implementation to this test suite You will need to add 3 endpoints to your implementation manifest.
- A credentials issuer endpoint (/credentials/issue) in the `issuers` property.
- A credentials verifier endpoint (/credentials/verify) in the `verifiers` property.
- A presentations verifier (presentations/verify) in the `vpVerifiers` property.

All endpoints will need the tag `vc.2.0`.
A simplified manifest would look like this:

```js
{
  "name": "My Company",
  "implementation": "My implementation",
  "issuers": [{
    "id": "",
    "endpoint": "https://issuer.mycompany.com/credentials/issue",
    "method": "POST",
    "tags": ["vc2.0"]
  }],
  "verifiers": [{
    "id": "",
    "endpoint": "https://verifier.mycompany.com/credentials/verify",
    "method": "POST",
    "tags": ["vc2.0"]
  }],
  "vpVerifiers": [{
    "id": "",
    "endpoint": "https://verifier.mycompany.com/presentations/verify",
    "method": "POST",
    "tags": ["vc2.0"]
  }]
}
```

This example above is an unauthenticated endpoint. You may add zcap or oauth authentication to your endpoints.

See the [README here](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api-test-suite-implementations).

To run the tests, some implementations require client secrets that can be passed as env variables to the test script. To see which ones require client secrets, you can check the [vc-api-test-suite-implementations](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api-test-suite-implementations) library.


### Docker (TODO)

We are currently adding a feature that would allow Docker images (using the VC API above) to be used instead of live endpoints. The docker image that you provide will be started when the test suite is run. The image is expected to expose the API provided above, which will be utilized in the same way that live HTTP endpoints are used above.
